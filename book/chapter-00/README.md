## What is a tool belt and why should I make one?

You don't have to create your own hammer to be able to build a house. Software development, however is a different beast altogether. It's different, because you too can make tools of equal if not even higher quality than the ones you already use. And for the curious, the added bonus of being able to look under the hood of whatever it is you're using is a great gift to understanding how code in general works, by reasoning on code written by somebody whose internal dialogue and reasoning is hidden from you.

A toolbelt is just what its name implies; something you take with you when you go to work on something, that gives you the alternative of being able to use a hammer to drive in nails instead of having to rely on rocks or having to make a hammer from scratch every time. It is a collection of generic functions specialized for just a single task—like the handle and head of a hammer—that you can combine to create new pieces of functionality—like a hammer. All those small and seemingly useless functions that don't necessarily make sense when you set out on your journey will turn into reliable friends that, while you feel like you couldn't function without them, will expose them as entirely ordinary pieces of functionality without any sort of magic involved. This essentially will demystify the tools you use as something you, too, can understand and reason about, and help make you into a better programmer by reducing the amount of "spray and pray" code you write. There is no room for faith if you can already know and rely on the result, even if you're not 100% involved in every step of the process.

But this is not just about creating a toolbelt. The toolbelt will function as a sort of segue between everything else that goes on in a project, from start all the way to the end. To mention some of the things you will learn to do apart from programming, you will also:

  - know how to set up a new project
  - be able to write code and target environments it would normally not run on
  - test the functions you write for correctness
  - combine functionality into a library
  - learn about the anatomy of an NPM project
  - publish your library onto the NPM registry
  - re-use your library in your other projects
  - set up an automated process to verify your code
  - set up code analysis tools that can flag problems for you that you might not have even considered

## Requirements

On the software side, you will need:

  - Node.js v8 or later
  - Git

Apart from installing software, you will need to register to a couple of on-line services. All of these are free for open-source projects (at least at the time of writing this), so they will not cost you anything.

  - [Github](https://github.com)
  - [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org)
  - [CodeClimate](https://codeclimate.com)

## The purpose of this book

> "One of the best programming skills you can have is knowing when to walk away for awhile."

## Using this book

  - tl;dr

## Why JavaScript?

  - widely used, "assembly for the web"
  - allows programming both in imperative as well as functional style
  - expressive
  - functions as first-class citizens (and what does "first-class citizen" mean?)
